# Really Functional Data Structures

Last time, David showed us functional data structures in the form of
*persistent data structures*. In this talk, I want to show you data
structures that are defined entirely by functions themselves -- no
classes, structs, bitmaps, etc.! Knowing about such structures not only
tickles the brain, but can also lead to a better intuition for solving
problems functionally. Also, one of the data structures shown can be
used for space-efficient encodings of fractals and animations.
